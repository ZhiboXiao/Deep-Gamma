    einops.rearrange is a reader-friendly smart element reordering for multidimensional tensors.
    This operation includes functionality of transpose (axes permutation), reshape (view), squeeze, unsqueeze,
    stack, concatenate and other operations.

    Examples for rearrange operation:

    >>> # suppose we have a set of 32 images in "h w c" format (height-width-channel)
    >>> images = [np.random.randn(30, 40, 3) for _ in range(32)]
    >>> # stack along first (batch) axis, output is a single array
    >>> rearrange(images, 'b h w c -> b h w c').shape
    (32, 30, 40, 3)
    >>> # concatenate images along height (vertical axis), 960 = 32 * 30
    >>> rearrange(images, 'b h w c -> (b h) w c').shape
    (960, 40, 3)
    >>> # concatenated images along horizontal axis, 1280 = 32 * 40
    >>> rearrange(images, 'b h w c -> h (b w) c').shape
    (30, 1280, 3)
    >>> # reordered axes to "b c h w" format for deep learning
    >>> rearrange(images, 'b h w c -> b c h w').shape
    (32, 3, 30, 40)
    >>> # flattened each image into a vector, 3600 = 30 * 40 * 3
    >>> rearrange(images, 'b h w c -> b (c h w)').shape
    (32, 3600)
    >>> # split each image into 4 smaller (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right), 128 = 32 * 2 * 2
    >>> rearrange(images, 'b (h1 h) (w1 w) c -> (b h1 w1) h w c', h1=2, w1=2).shape
    (128, 15, 20, 3)
    >>> # space-to-depth operation
    >>> rearrange(images, 'b (h h1) (w w1) c -> b h w (c h1 w1)', h1=2, w1=2).shape
    (32, 15, 20, 12)

    :param tensor: tensor of any supported library (e.g. numpy.ndarray, tensorflow, pytorch, mxnet.ndarray).
            list of tensors is also accepted, those should be of the same type and shape
    :param pattern: string, rearrangement pattern
    :param axes_lengths: any additional specifications for dimensions
    :return: tensor of the same type as input. If possible, a view to the original tensor is returned.

    When composing axes, C-order enumeration used (consecutive elements have different last axis)
